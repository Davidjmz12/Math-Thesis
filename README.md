# Spatial-Temporal Modelling using INLA - Math Thesis

This repository contains the code for my math thesis on spatial-temporal modelling using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). The project also includes a Shiny app that provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the models results.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: This directory contains all the source code used in the thesis.
- `data/`: This directory contains the datasets used, which have been uploaded using Git LFS.
- `shiny_app/`: This directory contains the Shiny app.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Davidjmz12/Math-Thesis.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Math-Thesis`

## Running the Shiny App

The Shiny app provides an interactive way to explore the spatial-temporal results. To run the Shiny app, follow these steps:

1. Open an R session.
2. Install the necessary R packages: `install.packages(c("shiny","ggplot2,"sf","patchwork","sp"))`
3. Run the app: `shiny::runApp(shiny_app)`

Please ensure you have the necessary packages installed and loaded in your R environment.
